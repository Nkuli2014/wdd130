    <h1>My Favourite City: Newcastle</h1>
    <p>
        Newcastle, Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, is my favourite city because it is where I grew up. 
        I always feel safe and at home when I am in Newcastle. It has a warm and welcoming atmosphere, 
        beautiful landscapes, and a strong sense of community.
