            <h2>About the Temple</h2>
            <p>The temple is a place of peace and learning. In October I will be going with the youth to the temple for the first time and they are very excited. I have been tyriying to get them to temple for 3 years now and finally Heavenly Father provided us with enough funds to go with 40 kids who attend Seminary religeously in our branch.
               I have been praying for them to experience great things that will not only impress them, but will help build their testimonies and I hope they will feel peace and learn a lot.</p>
